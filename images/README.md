## How to Add Images

1. Rename your images to match the filenames above
2. Place them in this folder
3. Make sure they are in JPG or PNG format
4. Optimize the images for web to ensure fast loading times

If you don't have actual project screenshots yet, you can use placeholder images from services like:

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
- [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)

Example of using Lorem Picsum for placeholders:
- `https://picsum.photos/800/450` - This will generate a random image at 800x450px
